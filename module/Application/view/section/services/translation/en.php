                        The studio started with a small space on Nevsky Prospect: 2 masters, a tiny office and a narrow specialisation - eyelash extensions. 
                        But we never stood still: training for the masters was added to the procedures. After 2 moves and a rebranding, we came to what we have now. 
                        800 square metres, the largest PRO Look training centre and UP-MAKE-UP studio, 
                        where in addition to eyelash and eyebrow design we delight our favourite clients with other beauty services.'
